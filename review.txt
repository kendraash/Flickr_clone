Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
  Needs a README!!
Is there good spec coverage?
  80% test coverage is pretty good! Needs more integration specs.
Do all specs pass?
  All unit tests pass. The only spec that doesn't is your only integration spec. Factorygirl is a pain.

  yes
Can you make a test payment through Stripe?
  Nope!
Is the site user-friendly?
  Intuitive UI. Looks clean and welcoming
Are there opportunities for refactoring?
  Nope, pretty clean code
What features stand out?
  Image search bar is awesome.
What features could be improved?
  Existing features are all good. Would recommend additional features such as comments, liking, tagging, etc.
Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
